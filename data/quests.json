He was a soldier then, and he was sent with his battalion to free a group of people that were enslaved for many, many years.\n\nA dispatch was sent to the town ahead of the battalion to allow everyone time to gather. The slaveholders and the enslaved were assembled and waiting when the soldiers arrived. Lorn was given a proclamation to read to the town. The proclamation announced that those currently in the bondage of slavery were freed and would be treated as such. Lorn’s battalion remained in the area only long enough to make sure the proclamation was obeyed, and then they moved on to their next assignment.\n\nTo this day, Lorn worries that he didn’t do enough to help those newly freed people. He did his duty and followed his orders, but those newly freed men and women and children needed more than being released from forced labor. They needed kindness, friendship, and support.\n\nEvery year on this day, Lorn remembers. Then, he tries to find someone around him that needs a little more help and he reaches out to help.\n\nLorn would like everyone in town to join him in celebrating this day of freedom by helping others. Will you join him and remember someone that needs help?",

There was no sign of the dragon except it’s trail leading to the trees where Lorn left it.\n\nNow, Lorn and Holger are going to town to see what happened, and to see if anyone needs help. Thomas will go with them. Lorn would like you and Vincent to go check Beatrix’s house, just in case the dragon went back there.\n\nIf you’ll give Holger and Thomas each a light to bring with them, Lorn will send you with his key to Beatrix’s house?",

WIZARD!\n\nAt this point, you begin to fear for your own safety. The room is now twice the size you remember it being. Fire is pouring out of your fireplace. Various pieces of furniture are levitating and vibrating uncontrollably.\n\n“YOUR FAMILY STARTED!”\n\nStar is now stomping on the letter and in quite a fit.\n\n“STARS AND STONES AND CURSED CREEK!”\n\nSuddenly, Star seems to realize his loss of control and the room instantaneously reverts to its previous state.\n\nStar takes a few extra moments to compose himself and turns to you with a big smile on his face.\n“Well well well, it seems I could use some more help in the future, and some good food. Maybe you can use this to help us both out now and in the future.”\nHe produces an orb that seems to be simultaneously opaque and completely transparent. \"You'll know what to do with this.\"\nROOMBA has stopped whirring, oblivious to whatever just happened, having finally cleaned up all the feathers as Star disappears in yet another shower of feathers.\n“ALERT! ALERT! FEATHER INTRUDERS! MAN THE BROOMS!”",

The stranger noticed Captain Thomas standing in the gateway and said simply that he didn’t want to leave his trident behind, but the gateway wouldn’t let him take it to the new world.\n\nCaptain Thomas waited with the man. While they waited, Captain Thomas introduced himself. The stranger called himself Poseidon and said it was a pleasure to meet Captain Thomas. Then, Poseidon fell quiet again, seemingly deep in thought.\n\nEventually Poseidon spoke. He told Captain Thomas about some of his greatest adventures. Poseidon traveled to many worlds, but this was to be his last voyage for some time. Then, Poseidon talked about all the friends and family he made on his travels. He said he would continue to watch out for them, but they would wonder where he went. Finally, he asked Captain Thomas to find a new owner for his trident.\n\nCaptain Thomas agreed to find a worthy owner for the trident. Then, Captain Thomas attempted to shake Poseidon’s hand. The gateway prevented the contact.\n\nPoseidon thanked Captain Thomas and then released the trident. The gateway and Poseidon vanished. Captain Thomas was left there alone with the trident.\n\nWill you accept the responsibility of this mighty weapon?

The constant vibrant energy of the town has been drained, replaced by townsfolk who keep to themselves, afraid of having to defend themselves from the consequences of any action that Ric might find unsavory in your – no, his – town.\n\nYou notice Rosalie walking out of the country store ahead, her countenance betraying the fake smile she flashes to you. You feel for the letter in your pocket reassuringly and approach her.\n\nAs if compelled, you hand her the letter you intended to deliver to her in private, and after a moment, she passes it back to you, fear and worry mar her features.\n\nDearest Rosalie,\nYou’re a real peculiar gem. I won’t be able to make it for dinner tomorrow. A shadow is falling.\nYours in magic,\nStar\nRosalie motions you silently to follow her and as you turn the corner, you collide with a figure and stumble backwards, the letter falling from your hands to the ground. Stunned for a moment, you check on your wounded pride and notice Beatrix reading the letter.\n\nAfter a moment, Beatrix begins to speak, but the words seem crisper, and more precise than you expect from her. “Tell us Child, what exactly have you gotten yourself into?”\nRosalie hastily retrieves the note from Beatrix and suggests you gather various tea supplies. You can meet her back at her home with Beatrix in a few days to avoid suspicion from Ric. As you turn to leave, Beatrix places a hand on your shoulder and draws you in closely, whispering, \"Geist really likes her tea with black powder and a bit of a bite, if you don't mind?\"",

The rabbit hops down so you can sit, knocking leeks all over the floor. You sit and stare as this very strange rabbit eats your produce. For a moment, he looks like he’s starting to choke, and a chunk of chewed up leek lands at your feet.\n“Hey.” He clears his throat. His voice is gravelly, and he has a strange accent. “Sorry, these things do NOT go down like carrots. Name’s frank. All lowercase.” He pauses to take another bite. “Let’s make a deal. I’ve got some pranks to pull, but no thumbs. Makes things difficult sometimes.” He doesn’t elaborate further, and crunches down on the last of your daily harvest. “I don’t even like leeks very much. Why’d you grow these things?” He tells you what he needs, and you put some lemons in a barrel. As soon as you put the lid on, the rabbit vanishes. He leaves some strange seeds behind.",

He also found that the facility was completely sealed up, and it looked like it was abandoned. Unfortunately, Cecil found nothing of interest in the whole building. He did bring up one little bauble to examine in his lab, but he doesn’t expect it to be worth anything.\n\nCecil would like to reset the magic seal with his fachetek and bury the hatch again. He thinks that there may be an opportunity to use the facility in the future, but he thinks it could be dangerous to leave it exposed like it is now. Will you handle the burying work while he informs Beatrix and Lorn about his findings?",

One day he was walking around the island with an orb of the glass that he made. He was looking to see if there were any reactions to the glass from other things on the island. Captain Thomas reached the eastern edge of the island a few minutes before the sun came up. As he was walking along the beach he reached down and pulled up a handful of sand. The excess sand falling from his hand stopped falling and remained in the air until the sun appeared. Then, the sand fell to the ground like normal.\n\nCaptain Thomas brought some of the western shore sand back to his shack and started experimenting. He discovered that this sand behaved very much like the sand near Thomas' shack, but only right before dawn. He also discovered that the two sands don't mix. They repel each other.\n\nWith this new knowledge, Captain Thomas went to explore the middle of the island. Just as he expected, Captain Thomas found that there is a line across the center of the island that is completely devoid of sand.\n\nCaptain Thomas would like to make some more glass using sand from both sides of the island.

    "text": "A few days later, your home remains quiet and noticeably uninterrupted. Trips into town have felt tense and you have intentionally avoided speaking to Beatrix and Rosalie except in passing. After gathering the items for tea, you arrive at Rosalie’s home, ready to discuss the letter and what has her so anxious with Beatrix.\nWhen you arrive, you’re surprised to find a third person sitting in a chair near Rosalie’s fireplace. Lorn greets you warmly and motions for you to join the group. Rosalie looks pensive, and Beatrix seems quiet and unreadable as ever. After sitting, the tense mood of the room becomes too much to bear, and Rosalie breaks the tension by suggesting tea.\nThe group prepare their tea, Beatrix adding some very odd ingredients to her tea in the process. After some time of small talk, the tension in the room again reaches palpable levels, and Lorn quietly draws the letter out of his pocket and says, “So, a peculiar gem?” Beatrix looks intently at Lorn, and for a moment, the fire seems to pulse in intensity, almost exactly at her pace of breathing, but you shake the feeling off as your imagination as Lorn continues, “I’ve heard many things about many various gems, but what do you all know about the power of gems?”\nRosalie blinks and gives Lorn an odd look, “Star hasn’t mentioned many things about gems, he seems to dislike a certain type, but I’ve never taken much notice to be honest.”\nBefore Lorn can reply, Beatrix in a crisp accent cuts him off, “Gems can hold many powers, they attune to the aether of the world, and some types have affinities towards elements and types of magic. For example, many of the elements attune to basic gems like rubies for fire, or emerald for earth. Using gems for magical enhancement is not a common art in the world any longer.”\nRosalie leans back looking surprised in her chair as what you now recognize as the voice of Geist speaks. Lorn takes a moment to process this information before continuing, “Indeed, I’ve heard similar stories about gems and magic, but there are some gems, some very peculiar, that seem to do things that defy a normal explanation.”\nThe fire in the room suddenly burns bright as Beatrix straightens and says, “I remember…fragments. A war! A gem! Pain! Loss…” \nSuddenly, Beatrix crumples to the ground as the fireplace loses intensity. Lorn and Rosalie rush to Beatrix’s aid. Her eyes open slightly, she looks directly at you and says, “I need rest…and the Flame Orb.”\nBeatrix closes her eyes, and Lorn asks you to gather some items to help Beatrix regain her strength.",

On the trip back to Rosalie’s house, several times you notice certain oddities around town. A home door ajar, blinds closed with windows open - at one point you swear you saw shadows that seemed to move even when you stood still. Hairs standing on end, you attempt to look casual as you head towards your destination. The sense of unease does not lift when you enter the house, instead worry and uncertainty are etched upon the faces of your friends. \nLorn explains, “Beatrix needs more time to recover, but we’re worried that her instability could cause serious consequences if she were to transform in town. I suggest we bring her to your farm house before we give her the flame orb. Rosalie has volunteered to cast a spell of illusion on a cart that we can use to transport Beatrix back to your home with little suspicion.” \nRosalie looks at you strangely, “Did you know orange is a great color for illusions? The more it moves the more it stops the illusion from distorting my aether matrix. That said, Beatrix has a very unique aura owing to her unique circumstances, I’m going to need a lot more orange things than I normally would to make sure this spell works.”",

Lorn arrives and begins smoking a pipe, his presence of calm and serenity have an immediate soothing impact to your frayed nerves. Rosalie steps out of the other room, and upon seeing Lorn mentions how thankful she is to him for helping restock some of her other magic supplies.\n“On the contrary, our dear friend here found most of the goods for you, but I did add a little something special for you myself.” Lorn replies. He winks slyly to Rosalie before settling into a chair. \nAfter putting some tea on, Beatrix sits down and invites you all to listen to her tale. She puts a hand on the flame orb and the orb emits a searing light and the words seem to rush out of Beatrix. \n\n“Many years ago, dragons and humans lived in relative peace. Magic was abundant in the land, and tribes grew up around different wizarding traditions. I grew up in such a tribe, but I was not born with any magical talent myself. Our family was well known, and one day, a man came to our tribe asking for help from wizards. Only later did they find out that there was a war between humans and dragons, and before we knew it, the war descended upon our tribe too. \nThe wrath of the dragons was terrible, and despite my pleading with father, the wizarding tribes were upset at the slaughter of humans and fought back. Many, many dragons died, and many of my friends and family died too. During the worst of the fighting, a dragon soared overhead, pleading with everyone to stop fighting and I was caught up in their words. I followed the dragon many miles and found her pleading with her brethren to stop the fighting. Her words fell on deaf ears, but I was so encouraged that I revealed myself to her and that is how Geist and I became comrades. We rushed to another battlefield to plead to stop the fighting, but it fell on deaf ears. In the fighting, Geist was wounded by a mage who held strange powers, and in my grief I screamed and shouted for the fighting to stop, but it never did… they wouldn’t stop fighting. They wouldn’t listen! In that moment, I lost all hope for humanity and dragonkind and laid beside Geist, waiting for the death of the battlefield I knew was inevitable.”\nBeatrix is now openly crying and Lorn puts a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. \nLorn suggests you take a few minutes to let Beatrix regain her composure, and through tears, Beatrix suggests Geist tell you the rest of the story. She asks for some surf and turf, because she’ll likely be hungry anyways, and asks you all to step outside.",

When spring ended, the eggs vanished until the following year. Then, the eggs reappeared, hidden in new locations.\n\nA few of the legends spoke of a 13th golden egg that held vast powers or wealth or something like that. No one ever found the 13th egg in any of the stories.\n\nVincent would like you to keep an eye out this spring for mysteriously decorated eggs in strange places. If the two of you can find the 12 springtime eggs, maybe you can find the golden egg too. Vincent would be happy to evenly split any profit that could be made from the golden egg.\n\nIf you’re interested, just bring any strange eggs you find to Vincent to prove and secure.",

After several seconds, you all step outside and see what you can only believe to be a dragon. Geist dwarfs your home, and she’s more majestic than a mountain. As she lowers her head to address you, flame crackles from her nose and a different fire burns in her eyes. It can only be described as sheer intelligent determination.\n\n“Greetings, I am Geist, and I owe you my unending thanks and gratitude for your care and friendship of my dear friend Beatrix. Rest assured that she is well and unharmed. This has been a traumatic several weeks for her, and I hope to ease her pain by telling you the rest of our story. I know you don't know me, but I know you all very well, as well as Beatrix herself does. Our shared memories make you all so familiar to me, I apologize if I address you all as if I've known you for years, because, you see, I have.\n\nIn that moment, so long ago, when Beatrix laid herself down beside me, I wept for the state of the world, for the wars and hatred that even I did not understand. To see so small a human laid low in empathy broke my heart, and it was in that moment of sadness and desperation to not see the world torn apart that something deep inside me changed. As I bled out from my strange wound, I blacked out, and when I came to, I was not me, but I was a part of Beatrix, and she was a part of me.\n\nWe eventually learned that only one of us could manifest at once, and through our experiences, Beatrix became so despondent that the only thing I could do for my dear friend was lock our memories away and give her a fresh start in a small village to live our life as normal as possible.\n\nI tell you this, because I believe the injustices we have seen Ric impose on our small town are as cruel as we have ever witnessed, and we know the loss and pain of friend and family. I want to help so I offer you this, the knowledge I have of the peculiar gem. Indeed, I have heard of it and I know it has power that neither Beatrix nor I understand. It seems crucial to understand why Star might have mentioned it now, and together we should seek this item out.”\n\nThe group stands around for a moment, deep in thought, when Lorn breaks the silence, “I have heard of this peculiar gem from travelers before, passed down by generations, its value incalculable to anyone. It seems to me the best path forward would be to speak with our resident collector, Cecil, mayhap he has heard of this gem, or has acquired it himself? I have no other leads to offer at this time, unfortunately.”\nEveryone agrees this seems like a reasonable first step, and the group decide it best to bring Cecil an offering of goodwill, knowing he is more open to talking about his collection when he’s adding to it.",

Cecil’s house is an oddity, older than many other homes in the town, but it has always seemed to come through tragedy untouched and looking quite pristine.\n\nRosalie knocks on Cecil’s door and at first, there is no answer. A few moments later, the large front door opens slowly, and Cecil appears with an annoyed look on his face. His eyes quickly flit to Rosalie and before she says anything, he looks to you and says quietly, “You may enter. The mage’s pupil is not allowed in under any circumstance. These are my terms.” His eyes look like they will brook no argument and Rosalie gives you a quizzical look before stepping away from the door.\n\nCecil opens the door wider and allows you inside. The majesty and size of his home is not lost on you in that moment, as the door opens to a great hallway full of trinkets and baubles that distract the eye and glitter in unique and fascinating ways. Cecil walks you to a room you’ve never been in before and your eyes are drawn to even more trinkets and the energy core you brought back from Romuska, placed on a mantle in a base overseeing the room. You notice a kind of black cord coming down the side of the mantle but before you can figure out where it goes, Cecil interrupts your reverie by coughing gently.\n\n“I know why you’re here, and I need your help. You see, Ric has been asking me for more and more money lately to fund his operation. Obviously, money is easy to come by, but I need to replenish my collection of items I sell to various vendors. In return, I will tell you what I know.”\n\nYou see no other avenue forward, and Cecil hands you a list of items he wants you to acquire. It’s strangely similar to items Rosalie and Star have asked you for in the past.",

The eggs glowed for hours and did nothing else. Confused, Vincent picked up the plate of eggs and moved toward his table. The eggs started glowing a soft green, but turned red again when he put the plate down.\n\nVincent picked the plate up again and started walking outside. The eggs glowed green whenever he was moving and got brighter when he moved toward the highland hills. So, he kept walking with the eggs right up to the center of the hills.\n\nSomewhere near the center of the hills, the eggs flashed like noonday sun. Vincent immediately stopped and sat down with the eggs while he waited for his eyes to readjust after the flash. When he finally looked around, Vincent saw something shiny in a knot of grass. It was the golden egg!\n\nThe decorated eggs stopped glowing after that flash, and nothing more happened when Vincent added the golden egg to the plate of decorated eggs. Whatever magic was at work in the eggs seems to be at rest now.\n\nNow, Vincent doesn’t know what to do with the eggs. He would love to make some money from them, but he feels like it isn’t really earned for his part. He’s also plenty satisfied just seeing legends he heard come to life.\n\nVincent thinks you should take the eggs. He appreciates all your hard work and figures that you deserve the reward for your efforts.",

This money will be extremely useful in the coming days to make safe the townsfolk all over this area. I see you still plan on visiting other townsfolk, well, if you want my advice, don’t trust anyone that won’t give you anything you want immediately.”\n\nYou leave, Ric’s words echoing in your ears. You decide the best approach is to talk to some of the townsfolk you are better acquainted with, and approach George’s home.\n\nAs luck would have it, George is sitting on his porch playing guitar and singing a song, you pause to listen before approaching him.\n\n“I’d give anything\n\nTo be where you’re at\n\nI’d do anything\n\nTo become what you are\n\nIt’s too late\n\nI don’t have what it takes\n\nI don’t have it\n\nI don’t have it\n\nSo move on\n\nI’m alright\n\nI need to move on now\n\nCause I’m gonna be alright”\n\nThe melody catches your ear, haunting but pleasant. There’s a strange comfort in the words, and you give George a moment to finish his song before you approach him any further.\n\nAfter handing him the gift basket, you ask him about Cecil and any strange occurrences in the town, and George shakes his head, he’s been focused on his music lately and hasn’t paid too much attention to more than he’s had to do for Ric, which are just standard dragon defense tactics.

Thomas ushers you down a side street towards his home. After a few moments, you regain your composure enough to assure Thomas that you are fine and ask him about Cecil and strange happenings.\n\nThomas gives you a second strange look and breaks out in a belly laugh. “Oh, do you mean besides the dragon attack? Or Ric Ryph? Or perhaps you mean the fact that *I caught all these fish?!*” Thomas proudly shows you a drying rack with three trout.\n\n“Fished ‘em myself! Maybe I’m not a lost cause afterall, eh?”",

Beatrix started to dismiss the thought, but it came again, and it felt so comfortable. So, she poured a bit of the grape juice on her very freshly sprouted radishes. Instantly, the radish stems and leaves elongated to their full-grown height.\n\nBeatrix carefully pulled a radish from the ground and examined it. The radish was fully grown and perfectly ripe! Beatrix couldn’t believe it. She pulled the rest of the radishes and all were alike, ripe and fully grown.\n\nBeatrix is now tangled in curiosity. She wants to know more about this phenomenon.

Then, Borgen had a breakthrough: peach juice!\n\nUnfortunately, the peach juice has an unwanted side effect for a seller of fine goods like Borgen. It makes you invisible for a short duration after you drink it. Nevertheless, maybe you could find a use for this peach juice. Borgen would be happy to share it with you at a very reasonable price.",

Star has corrected this issue, but now he needs to correct both the architectural and logistical distribution. That’s where he needs your help.\n\nWill you accept another mystical staff and keep it secret, and keep it safe, until Star or one of his duly authorized messengers calls for it?",
